### Standup 

##### Standup - 10-15min

Useful questions: 
    1.  How did I find yesterday?
    2.  What will I work on today?
    3.  Am I blocked by anything?

Useful tips: 
    1. When scope creep is happening, try to pull back

##### Review - 15-30min
1. Homework? Project additions or subjects to study?

##### Working structure

Mobbing at the start, but try to split into pairs/solo so everyone has the opportunity to get really focus deeply on parts/peices of the code.

Will we try an hour in the middle of the day, like 1pm-2pm or so, we all go to sit solo, and look over whatever we've done so far that day, and then formulate any questions to the group/think of any imporovements we think could be done, then when we come back we can go through it all together?

#### Team tools for use

Trello, excalidraw, obsidian.
