I'm a waiter working at TGI fridays looking to move jobs. I want to know how much I will get paid and the breakdown of that pay (base, real take home tips, paid in cash or card, even split/tip pool), work culture (team environment, shift patterns staff turnover), benefits (meals/no meals). I'm a waiter working at TGI fridays looking to move jobs. Lastly, I would like to connect with current or former employees of the potential employer to gain insight into their experiences working there.
